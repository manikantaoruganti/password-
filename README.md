✅ Project Name:
Secure Password Vault (or) Local Password Manager

🔍 Short Description:
A secure, browser-based password manager that allows users to save, encrypt, and retrieve passwords locally without any backend.

This is a Password Vault Web Application developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that securely stores user credentials in the browser using AES-GCM encryption via the Web Crypto API.
 It does not require any external database or server — all data is encrypted and stored in localStorage.
 The app demonstrates essential IT/CSE concepts like data security, encryption, client-side storage, and UI/UX design, making it both a practical and academic-level project.

📌 Key Features:
Encrypts passwords using AES-GCM (military-grade encryption).


Stores encrypted data locally — offline and private.


Dynamic UI for adding and viewing credentials.


Includes auto-updating copyright.


Lightweight and runs in any modern browser.



💡 Why It’s Important:
Demonstrates real-world application of data privacy and cryptography.


Shows practical usage of JavaScript Web APIs.


Introduces basic secure software design principles.


Encourages security-first thinking in software development.
